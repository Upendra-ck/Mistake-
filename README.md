# Mistake-
This project aims to prevent repeated mistakes by recording and analyzing past errors. When a similar mistake occurs, the system alerts the user that it has happened before, helping avoid it in the future. The main goal is to create a learning loop from past actions to improve decision-making and reduce recurring errors.
